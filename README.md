Assumptions:
1.	Phone numbers might have country code and special characters like ‘+’,’_’.
2.	Time interval might have brief explanation of interval such as “After 2 days”, “Next Monday early in the morning”, or “ 4 pm on Nov 20”

Improvements
1.	Phone numbers validation should be implemented.
2.	Despite using in-memory caching, other optimized tools like “Redis” can be used.
3.	 To optimize performance, pagination can be implemented.
4.	There might be more test cases which can lead to bugless features.
5.	Implementation of logger might help to debugging.
